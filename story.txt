My high school teacher always complain about me being too annoying in class. One day, my teacher shouted:"Allen, go outside!
You are too annoying" I was so angry and I broke the door and went Into the classroom...

Then I saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It's his classmate Graham.

How are you going today?

"Not bad." Graham said.

The next time I remember was that I stood outside the classroom again. "Well, I got you this time" I heard teacher murmuring.
I am groot
I am groot
